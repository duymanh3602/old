**Hi sir!**
- Firstly, thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself to your organisation.
- My name is **Dinh Duy Manh (Đinh Duy Mạnh)**, I'm 20 years old, a Sophomore of Information Technology at **VNU Hanoi - University of Engineering and Technology** (VNU-UET). My major is **Programing**, and it is very interesting to study. I grew up in **Thai Nguyen**, but I have been living in **Ha Noi** for about two years. I belong to a lower middle-class with five member in my family, my Grandmother, my Father, my Sister, my younger brother and I. I love my family so much.  I have medium height, black hair, black eyes and thin lips. I watch TV as well as "coding" a lot, and I guess they are the reason why I have poor eyesight. What I love to do in my free time is workout, listening to music, and watching movies. Besides my major in programing, I also like English, and I have been taking some extra English classes lately. Therefore, I try to combine my study and hobbies by reading books and listening to music in English. 
- I have some other talents such as singing. I love to sing about the Ballad or Romantic song. My friends say that I am a friendly, hardworking, but a little bit shy person. I rarely talk to new friends in my class, and I avoid to be present in any crowd. I only feel confident around some of my best friends, and it is one of the weak point that I need to improve. My dream after I graduate is to work in a big international incorporation, so I always try my best to study and research in many necessary fields since now. I am living a interesting life, and I am very satisfied with myself.
- That’s all about me. Thank you. Cheers!!!.
